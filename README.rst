FOP(Feature Oriented Programming) for javascript - this is a port of http://github.com/henzk/featuremonkey from python to javascript.

You can use this to build feature oriented software product lines in javascript.

Currently, documentation is severly lacking ... i am on the job... stay tuned!

Example Product Line
----------------------

A product line of todo list applications built with ``featuremonkey.js`` can be found in the ``example_spl`` folder or online `here <http://featuremonkey_js.schnapptack.de/latest/example_spl>`_ .
